Detailed Code Explanation
1. Environment Setup and Configuration
Environment Variables: The code starts by loading environment variables from a .env file using load_dotenv(). These variables include Salesforce credentials like SALESFORCE_CLIENT_ID, SALESFORCE_CLIENT_SECRET, SALESFORCE_USERNAME, SALESFORCE_PASSWORD, and SALESFORCE_TOKEN_URL.

Logging: Configures logging to output informational, warning, and error messages to the console.

Constants: Defines constants such as BATCH_SIZE (number of records per batch operation), RETRY_ATTEMPTS (number of retry attempts for failed operations), RETRY_DELAY (delay between retries), MAX_RECENT_RECORDS (maximum number of recent records to store), and FIELDS (list of Account fields to interact with).

FastAPI App: Initializes a FastAPI application instance.

2. Custom Classes
SalesforceError: A custom exception class to handle Salesforce-specific errors.

FailedRecord: A class to represent a record that failed to be processed (inserted, updated, or deleted). It stores the record, the error message, and a timestamp.

to_dict(): Converts the FailedRecord object to a dictionary for easy serialization.

RecentDataManager: Manages a list of recently processed records.

add_records(): Adds new records to the recent records list, maintaining a maximum size. It also includes the operation type in the records to identify if it was inserted, updated, or deleted.

get_records(): Returns the list of recent records.

Initialization: Creates an instance of RecentDataManager called recent_data_manager.

3. File Handling Functions
read_file_data(file_path): Reads data from a file (CSV, JSON, or XML) and returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a record.

It handles different file formats using appropriate libraries (pandas for CSV, json for JSON, xml.etree.ElementTree for XML).

save_to_file(data, file_path): Saves a list of dictionaries to a file in the specified format (CSV, JSON, or XML).

It includes custom XML pretty printing for better readability.

4. Salesforce Authentication
authenticate_salesforce(): Authenticates with Salesforce using the provided credentials and the OAuth 2.0 password grant type.

It sends a POST request to the Salesforce token URL to obtain an access token and instance URL.

Returns a simple_salesforce.Salesforce instance if authentication is successful.

Raises a SalesforceError if authentication fails or if any required credentials are missing.

5. Data Cleaning and Storage Check
clean_record(record): Cleans a record dictionary by handling NaN values and converting floats to integers for specific fields (AnnualRevenue, NumberOfEmployees).

check_storage_availability(sf): Checks if the Salesforce instance has enough storage available by attempting to create and then delete a test record. Returns True if storage is available, False otherwise.

Knowledge Transfer (KT) Document
Title: Salesforce Data Integration System
1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Salesforce Data Integration System, designed to facilitate seamless data transfer between files (CSV, JSON, XML) and a Salesforce instance. The system allows users to upload, retrieve, update, and delete data, providing a user-friendly interface and robust API endpoints.

2. System Architecture

The system comprises the following components:

Frontend: A Gradio-based web interface for user interaction.

Backend: A FastAPI server exposing API endpoints for programmatic access.

Data Handling: Functions to read and write data from/to CSV, JSON, and XML files.

Salesforce Interaction: Functions to authenticate with Salesforce and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Account objects.

Error Handling: Mechanisms to handle potential errors, including Salesforce authentication failures, storage limitations, and data processing issues.

Retry Logic: Implemented for Salesforce operations to handle transient errors and improve reliability.

Recent Data Management: A component to track and display recently processed records.

3. Key Features

Data Upload: Users can upload CSV, JSON, or XML files containing data to be inserted into Salesforce.

Data Retrieval: Users can retrieve data from Salesforce and save it to a file in CSV, JSON, or XML format.

Data Update: Users can upload files to update existing records in Salesforce based on their IDs.

Data Deletion: Users can upload files containing record IDs to delete data from Salesforce.

Batch Processing: Data is processed in batches to handle large datasets efficiently and avoid Salesforce API limits.

Retry Mechanism: Failed operations are retried multiple times with a delay to handle temporary issues.

Storage Limit Check: The system checks for Salesforce storage availability before inserting data.

Recent Records Tracking: The system keeps track of recently processed records and displays them in the UI.

API Endpoints: RESTful API endpoints are provided for uploading, retrieving, updating, and deleting data.

User Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Gradio allows easy interaction with the system.
